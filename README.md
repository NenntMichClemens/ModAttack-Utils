# 🔧 - ModAttack-Utils
› This is a Minecraft-Spigot plugin, which was coded for a private Minecraft Project called "ModAttack". It was created because we couldn't find plugins that would cover all our needs so we decided to create one on our own. It contains a somewhat complex clan-system, a TPA-System (Teleport requests) and some small extras, such as Head-Drops, a spawn protection, a combat-log system and much more. Since the project is over now and the plugin is no longer in private use, I decided to release it publicly. 

> Please note, that some systems might not work as expected. It's possible that you need to change some code to make it work for you. I tried to optimize the code a bit and fix some bugs but there can still be some bugs and problems I didn't notice.
